# Hill-and-Valley-Prediction
The "Hill and Valley Prediction" project aims to develop a predictive model or tool that can identify and analyze the topographical features of terrain, 
specifically locating hills and valleys. This technology can have applications in various fields, including geospatial analysis, 
environmental monitoring, and outdoor navigation. By processing data, such as elevation maps or geographical coordinates,
the project seeks to provide valuable insights into the landscape's topography, which can be utilized for mapping, planning, and decision-making purposes.
